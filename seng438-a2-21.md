# 1 Introduction
This report demonstrates the different strategies Group 21 used when testing the Range class and DataUtilities class. Some of our strategies involved equivalence class testing, boundary value analysis and stubs/mocking. This lab focused more on the mocking strategy since the DataUtilities class depends on external classes. We are only testing the classes mentioned above so we must set up a mocking environment that does not depend on other classes' functionality. Equivalence class testing was used in order to reduce the number of test cases per method we needed to do as this strategy groups inputs that result in the same behavior of the program and boundary analysis was used to test the behavior of the boundaries of the equivalence classes. Overall, this report provides insight into the thorough and comprehensive testing approach taken by our group for the Range and DataUtilities classes.

# 2 Detailed description of unit test strategy
Our test strategy that we used while writing our tests was equivalence classes and boundary value analysis. For equivalence classes, we partitioned the input data into distinct groups of equivalent data, such that each group represents a class of inputs that are expected to behave similarly with respect to the program under test. This approach helps us to reduce the overall number of test cases required to cover all the input scenarios. For boundary value analysis, we tested the program behavior at the boundaries of the input domain or boundaries between equivalence classes, namely, for the Range class we would test at the upper and lower bounds of the input range. We did this to identify any errors that may arise due to incorrect handling of edge cases.

# 3 Test cases developed
Below are two charts that groups each of the test cases that were designed for the program

Some of the benefits we noticed while using mocking are:
a. Benefits -
1. Mocking enables the simulation of various scenarios, including adding one or more Classes to the test, that may not be possible to test otherwise.
2. Mocking enables the testing of the program's interactions with its dependencies.
3. It is easy to perform isolated testing of the program without having to worry about actual dependencies being present.

b. Drawbacks - 
1. Mocking can increase the complexity of the test cases and make them harder to understand and write, we came into difficulties setting up the test cases for the DataUtilities Class since mocking was required for them.
2. Mocking can result in the creation of test cases that do not reflect real-world scenarios, leading to a false sense of security about the program's behavior.


# 4 How the team work/effort was divided and managed

We split up the work in this lab based on the classes that needed to be tested. Ideen and Brian were responsible for 2 of the Range tests, and 2 of the DataUtilities tests. Dimitar and Javier were responsible for 3 Range tests and 3 DataUtilities tests. Since Dimitar and Javier were responsible for more tests, Ideen and Brian took more responsibility for the Lab Report. One of the lessons we learned while working in this lab was that it is better to work as a group/partner rather than splitting things up individually. It is better to work in a group because it is more efficient, and we can bounce ideas off each other. While learning something new, it can sometimes feel challenging to figure out where to start and how to work effectively on it. Tackling the unit tests using a pair programming approach helped with this as it helped to have someone to talk things through with. Additionally, while we worked on the unit tests in pairs, we still met as a group so we can further discuss any challenges we came across as groups. We learned that this approach was the most effective as we were able to work closely with a partner to write the tests and work with our entire group to discuss higher-level challenges and concepts. We also had regular checkups as a group to make sure all tasks were on track to be completed on behind and nobody was falling behind.


# 5 Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

The Javadoc for the classes/interface being tested does not have a clear description of what the program should do on some inputs, or what it should return. It was good to come up with test cases as a group since we all had different ideas on how to test something and what valid or invalid data should look like. We also learned that planning the test cases out beforehand leaves a smoother process to start the test suite. 

# 6 Comments/feedback on the lab itself

- The lab document did not specify how to format each of the tests, i.e. whether to put each test case in its own file, whether to write a @Before and @After for each individual test case
